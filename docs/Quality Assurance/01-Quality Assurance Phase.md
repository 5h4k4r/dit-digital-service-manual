# Quality Assurance Phase

Once the development of the software is complete in each sprint, it will be handed over to the Quality Assurance Team along with the technical documentations prepared in the Discovery Phase.

Based on the provided technical documentations, the QA team will plan and test the system properly. When there is a bug or an improvement needed, it will be reported to the development team. Upon a fix by the Development Team, it will be re-tested by the QA team again. This cycle will continue until the software is stable to ensure delivering high-quality services that match user needs and stockholders expectations.

It is highly recommended to involve the QA Team from the early stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Integrating QA practices at the beginning will result in a well-planned and executed project that successfully delivers high value to the stockholders.
