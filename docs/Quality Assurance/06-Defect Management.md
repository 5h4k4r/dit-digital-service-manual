# Defect Management

Defect Management is a method for identifying and resolving defects. The steps of a defect management cycle are as follows:

1. Detection of a Defect
2. Categorization of Defects 
3. Defect Fixing by Developers 
4. QA team verification 
5. Defect Closure

All the defects that are found in the testing phase should be recorded in a template like [this](https://govkrd.b-cdn.net/Digital%20Service%20Manual/Defect%20Management%20Template.xlsx).
