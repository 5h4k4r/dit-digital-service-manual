# Test Execution

Test execution is the process of executing the test cases and comparing the expected and actual results to ensure the fulfillment of the pre-defined requirements and specifications of the developed software product. Moreover, it is responsible for deciding the readiness of the software product. If the results of this execution are similar to the expected or desired results, the software product is considered ready to go to production. Otherwise, it may have to go through SDLC and STLC, again.

## Software Testing Types

Software testing is generally classified into two main broad categories: **functional testing** and **non-functional testing**. 

### 1. Functional Testing

Functional testing involves the testing of the functional aspects of a software application. When you’re performing functional tests, you have to test each and every functionality. You need to see whether you’re getting the desired results or not.

There are several types of functional testing, such as:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- User Acceptance testing
- Smoke testing
- Sanity testing
- Regression testing
- Acceptance testing
- White box testing
- Black box testing
- Interface testing

Functional tests are performed both manually and using automation tools.

### 2. Non-functional Testing

Non-functional testing is the testing of non-functional aspects of an application, such as performance, reliability, usability, security, and so on. Non-functional tests are performed after the functional tests.

There are several types of non-functional testing, such as:

- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Load testing
- Compatibility testing
- Usability testing
- Scalability testing
- Volume testing
- Stress testing
- Efficiency testing
- Reliability testing
