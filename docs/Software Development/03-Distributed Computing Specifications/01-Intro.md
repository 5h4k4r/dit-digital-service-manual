# Intro
The guides below aim to clarify principles and design decisions when creating distributed systems. Whether the software you are building is distributed or centralized, it is important to follow the points mentioned in this sections. This will make sure that any centralized software can later be transformed into a distributed system without much headache.

If it is absolutely necessary to avoid conforming to the principles of this section, communicate the matter with the Head of Digital Development to obtain an approval. Otherwise, conformity to this section is mandatory.
