# Deadlines
All agreed deadlines must be kept as they are unless it is specified or extended explicitly by the Head of Digital Development Team. <u>Members of the Digital Development Team</u> are not obligated to accommodate for requests for late-term changes in the requirements. 

In case if priorities change and the agreed deadlines cannot be met, it must be properly communicated to the Head of Digital Development Team in order to come up with a new agreement. 

Each release development must come with a time plan that is approved by the Head of Digital Development Team.
