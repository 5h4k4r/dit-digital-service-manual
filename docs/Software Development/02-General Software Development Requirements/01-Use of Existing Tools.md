# Use of existing tools

In the development of different software solutions, it is recommended to use well-known and community-supported open-source libraries, tools, and projects that are preferably under the MIT Software License. We encourage developers to move away from packages that: 

1. Have not been updated in the past 18 months.
2. Have several open issues that are left unresolved for more than 6 months
3. Have not been adopted as a solid solution by the community.

On GitHub, we advise checking the number of stars and forks before deciding to move with an open-source library. 

Close-sourced libraries require internal approval. We do not allow closed-source software to be used without a pre-approved process. If the necessity for such a use case arises, consult with the Head of Digital Development and the Head of DevOps at DIT.
