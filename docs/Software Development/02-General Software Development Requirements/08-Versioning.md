# Versioning
We follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) standards to version releases. Accordingly, software applications must be versioned with the following pattern: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.



## Releases

Releases must be versioned with the same rules of Semantic Versioning while making sure that each release receives a unique version number.

## Web Applications

All web applications must be versioned appropriately and conform to the rules of this section. The version number must be displayed on the application's user interface unless it is specified and agreed by the Head of Digital Development Team. Manifest files in the code bases must be updated to reflect the release version. 

## CLI Applications

In case of command line applications, an option must be provided (suggestion â€“v) to display the version.
